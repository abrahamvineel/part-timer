## Discussion items:

Allow users to enter work/home locations 
Just store them for now - GPS coordinates of locations
We should have removed home locations from our functionality. We will not only have to pull GPS locations now, but now we may have to determine a way to plot routes and generate recommended departure times.

Get app to recognize when user has entered or left a specific location
This involves accessing the GPS functionality of the phone.
Track time spent at specific locations
Further than checking in, we will need to constantly keep tabs on the GPS location of the user to track time spent at a location.

Display this data somewhere in the application.
We should pull from some universally accessible (within the app) pool of checkin-checkout data to populate the stats and home page. We can spoof some of this data initially, but we should try to find a way to organically add to this data through actual GPS use if possible.



## Decisions:

Storing data -  how to make it accessible  (**Mohan**) 

GPS tracking - checkin/checkout (**Dinesh**) 

Hammer out design (**Vamsi initial, Al rework**) 

Project update 2 drafting/topics/maintenance (**Al**)

Wrangle git into order (**Al**) 

Clickstreams (**Vineel**) 

Remove Login page and Calendar page for now
